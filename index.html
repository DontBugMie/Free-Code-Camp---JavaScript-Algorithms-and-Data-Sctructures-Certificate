    <h3> Object Oriented Programming: Defining a Constructor Function</h3>
    
    
    <h6>What is a Constructor?</h6>
    
    <ul>
    <li>
        A Function that creates a new object. <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        The Constructor defines behaviors and properties that will below to the new object.
    </li>
    <li>
        This is the blueprint of objects, the adam to mankind.
    </li>
    <li>A Constructor is defined using a capital letter - this is to distinguish between other functions </li>
    <li>
        "this" is used in Constructors to set properties of the object they will create. Inside of the constructor "this refers to the new object it will create". "this" = refer to new object 
    </li>
    <li>
        Instances can be created from Constructor functions
    </li>
</ul>
